# Project name - Optimus Prime beer version

# Idea of the project
We just want to make an interesting game which is perfect for people to have fun after work.

# Rules
The purpose of this project is to remember a sequence of colors.
After that there will be another series of colors and the players need
to push and if the fastest player is right, others will drink beer.
However, if the fastest player is wrong, only he/she will drink beer.  

# Schematics
The circuit for decreasing voltage from 220V to 12V was taken from [here](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/control-high-voltage-devices-arduino-relay-tutorial/). And full scheme can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eLCSliN0eeikoplY6JHye9F3WUqbxg_x).
